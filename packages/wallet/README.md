# ArSnap Wallet

*ArSnap's official wallet.*

---

## Purpose

As MetaMask doesn't currently include a way of extending/modifying its UI through Snaps, we have to
come up with a separate solution in order to expose ArSnap functionnalities to users. ArSnap Wallet
is here to fill this role but it also serves other purposes:

1. It's aiming at becoming a full-fledged Arweave wallet allowing you to: manage Arweave keys, send
   AR, views all the transactions attached to a wallet, amongst other things

2. But it's also the main way through which you will be able to configure ArSnap, review how dApps
   you're connected to are using your keys, review the permissions you granted them, ...

3. While we want it to be the Wallet of reference for many things you'd need to do with ArSnap, all
   of its abilities are procured by the Adapter, which is what developers will use to integrate any
   dApp with ArSnap. So if you're eager to see how a dApp should integrate with ArSnap, the Wallet
   also serves as a complete example!

## Hosted on the Permaweb

Thanks to the power of Arweave, we will upload every new versions of ArSnap Wallet to the Permaweb,
allowing you to rest assured that it will forever be available.
