# Adapter

*The door to ArSnap awesomeness.*

---

The Adapter defines ArSnap's API and also exposes them. If you want to integrate ArSnap into your
dApp without thinking about compatibility with the existing ArConnect's API, you'll only need this
package.

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get your hands dirty with the Adapter is to check the example included here [in
the example folder](example).

All the functions from ArSnap's API are commented and located in [src/api.ts](src/api.ts). You can
also find additional helper functions in [src/helpers.ts](src/helpers.ts) to help you achieve
higher-level tasks like signing a transaction or sending winstons to an address.
