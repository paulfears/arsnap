# Adapter

*The door to ArSnap awesomeness.*

---

The Adapter defines ArSnap's API and also exposes them. If you want to integrate ArSnap into your
dApp without thinking about compatibility with the existing ArConnect's API, you'll only need this
package.

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get your hands dirty with the Adapter is by checking the example included here
in [the example folder](/packages/adapter/example). You can also learn about all the different
available functions by looking at [the documentation](/packages/adapter/docs/modules.md).
