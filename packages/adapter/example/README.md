# Simple Example Using The Adapter

This is a simple commented example demonstrating how to:

- Connect to ArSnap
- Manage the permissions of a dApp
- Display the user's active wallet's address
- Sign a message with the user's active wallet

## Test It Yourself

Run the following commands in your terminal:

1. `git clone https://github.com/pianity/arsnap`
1. `cd arsnap`
1. `yarn install`
1. `cd packages/adapter`
1. `yarn example`

Now you should be able to head over to http://localhost:3000/ and start playing with the example!
You can edit its code in [index.ts](index.ts) and the page will update automatically, allowing you
to easily start trying out the API.
