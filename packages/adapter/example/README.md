# Simple Example Using The Adapter

This is a simple commented example demonstrating how to:

- Connect to ArSnap
- Manage the permissions of a dApp
- Display the user's active wallet's address
- Sign a message with the user's active wallet

## Test It Yourself

Run the following commands in your terminal:

1. `git clone https://github.com/pianity/arsnap`
2. `cd arsnap`
3. `yarn install`
4. `cd packages/adapter`
5. `yarn example`

You should now be able to head over to <http://localhost:3000/> and start playing with the example!
You can edit its code in [index.ts](/packages/adapter/example/index.ts) and the page will update
automatically, allowing you to easily start trying out [the
API](/packages/adapter/docs/modules.md).
